JPath

author: Spondon Saha


Intended to work just like XPath, but for Json files. The syntax is aimed to be
just like Xpath. Currently, it does not support all Xpath-like functionalities,
but can accept a path-string and use it get value for a certain element

Future plans are to provide support for wild-characters and iterables.

This document will be updated as new functionalities appear.
